It would be a real shame if people understood that an inexpensive VPN or proxy service can make it appear that your IP originates in Texas and allow you access sites that are restricted to in-state IP addresses. 

It would also be just awful if people knew that you can generate six fake Texas addresses in seconds at: https://coolgenerator.com/address-generator

I probably shouldn't mention that you can download a list of thousands of fake names in minutes at: https://fakenamegenerator.com/order 

I seriously should not bring up that fake, one time email addresses can be had at: https://throwawayemail.com 

Because it would be truly terrible if starting September 1, every day hundreds of plausible but fake reports were submitted to: https://prolifewhistleblower.com/anonymous-form/

Because it seems like this site was started by a private organization, and I'm sure the authorities would be slightly upset if they were handed a hundred or so fake tips daily.

Even if the folks running it did do some checking before filing police reports or lawsuits, it would be terrible if their manpower and IT resources were drained by having to filter through hundreds or even thousands of plausible reports daily.

If they're leasing server time from a cloud provider, they may even be charged a variable rate based on site traffic and server usage. So it's possible they could incur some fairly high costs, even if they put an app in place to automatically filter reports.

That would be a damn shame, wouldn't it?

It would be even worse if someone programmed a bot to do this automatically at random intervals.
